Folktizen is built for the community, and its long-term vision is to operate as a fully decentralized protocol governed by its most active users—creators, curators, and contributors. Governance is key to ensuring the platform remains fair, transparent, and aligned with the interests of its participants.

**Governance Principles**:

- **Progressive Decentralization**: Governance rights will be gradually transferred to the community as the platform matures.
- **Token-Based Voting**: FOLK token holders will have the power to propose and vote on protocol changes.
- **Transparent Decision-Making**: All proposals and voting outcomes will be publicly viewable and executed on-chain.

**Governance Powers**:

- **Meme Coin Approval Rules**: Decide how new meme proposals move through Genesis, Bonding, and Graduation.
- **Treasury Management**: Allocate funds for growth, rewards, partnerships, and ecosystem development.
- **Reward System Adjustments**: Modify Like-to-Earn or Trade-to-Earn incentives based on platform performance and user behavior.
- **Protocol Upgrades**: Approve technical improvements, new features, and integrations.
- **Partnership & Integration Approvals**: Decide on official collaborations with DAOs, apps, and creators.

**Participation and Reputation**:

Governance participation will be tied to on-chain activity and reputation systems. Long-term contributors, meme creators, and engaged users will have more influence, encouraging meaningful involvement over speculative behavior.

Governance ensures that Folktizen is not just built for the people—but also by the people.
