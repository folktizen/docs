FOLK is the native utility and rewards token of the Folktizen platform. It powers everything from meme discovery to creator incentives, and plays a key role in user participation, governance, and protocol sustainability. Designed with long-term ecosystem health in mind, FOLK aligns the interests of creators, supporters, and platform stakeholders.

**Utility of FOLK**:

- **Staking & Voting**: Users stake FOLK to back meme coin creators and signal social consensus.
- **Creator Support**: FOLK is used to boost meme visibility and unlock premium features.
- **Rewards Mechanism**: Distributed through Like-to-Earn and Trade-to-Earn systems.
- **Access to Features**: Required for advanced analytics, creator tools, and governance proposals.

**FOLK Token Distribution**:

- **40% Community Rewards**: Distributed to users, creators, and curators via engagement and contribution incentives.
- **20% Team & Advisors**: Vested over 36 months with a 6-month cliff to align long-term incentives.
- **20% Treasury**: Managed via governance, used for ecosystem expansion, partnerships, and grants.
- **10% Partners & Grants**: Allocated to early backers, collaborators, and community builders.

**Supply Control & Sustainability**:

FOLK has a capped supply. Token emissions are managed via protocol rules and governed by the community. Deflationary mechanisms such as token burns on premium placements and swap fees ensure long-term value preservation.

FOLK is more than a token—it’s a tool to channel attention into action and transform culture into capital.
