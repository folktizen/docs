Folktizen is designed to feel as intuitive as scrolling social media, while embedding meaningful crypto mechanics under the hood. Users can seamlessly move from passive discovery to active participation and investment in meme coin launches. Here’s how a typical journey unfolds:

1. **Discover (Genesis Stage)** \
  Users land on a TikTok-style feed of meme coin pitches. Each pitch includes a short video or image, a title, a description, and creator details. Users swipe to browse, just like social media.

2. **Engage** \
  If a user likes a meme idea, they can engage by liking, commenting, sharing, or tipping the creator with FOLK. Each like earns small rewards via the Like-to-Earn mechanism, which drives viral feedback loops.

3. **Stake Support** \
  Users can signal stronger interest by staking FOLK tokens on a meme coin pitch. This helps surface popular ideas and gives creators early credibility and rewards.

4. **Bond (Bonding Stage)** \
  Once a meme idea reaches a staking threshold, it enters the Bonding phase. Here, users can commit ETH in exchange for a future allocation of the meme token. This signals real support and pre-funds the launch.

5. **Launch (Graduation Stage)** \
  If bonding goals are met, the meme coin is officially launched. A smart contract mints the token, liquidity is added, and trading begins. Early supporters receive their allocations, and creators are rewarded in ETH and FOLK.

6. **Earn & Repeat** \
  Users earn Like-to-Earn and Trade-to-Earn rewards. Their in-app reputation grows. They can return to discover new memes, build their own, or curate the ecosystem.

This user journey is deliberately simple, gamified, and social, encouraging viral discovery while onboarding users to on-chain behavior without friction or intimidation.
