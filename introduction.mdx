[Folktizen](https://folktizen.xyz) is a next-generation meme coin launchpad that combines the viral engagement of TikTok-style content with the decentralized power of Arbitrum. It’s designed for creators, degens, and everyday users to participate in the full lifecycle of meme coin projects—from discovery to investment to full launch—within a gamified and highly social platform.

The platform offers a swipe-based interface that feels familiar to younger audiences, but under the hood, it introduces a novel token launch structure powered by the FOLK token. Users can browse meme pitches in short, video-style or image + caption formats, stake support with FOLK, bond ETH to promising ideas, and watch them graduate into tradeable tokens.

Folktizen transforms attention into currency. By aligning viral culture with token economics, it unlocks a more fun, accessible, and community-driven way to discover and invest in early-stage memecoins. The project is designed to be modular and composable with other Arbitrum protocols, helping onboard a new generation of users to Web3 while growing the meme economy through structured participation, creator tools, and transparent incentives.

Whether you’re a casual browser, a serious degenerate, or an aspiring meme coin creator, Folktizen offers a playground where memes meet markets, speculation meets storytelling, and every like can lead to liquidity.
