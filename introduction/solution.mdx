Folktizen reimagines the meme coin launchpad as a TikTok-style, swipe-based social experience that makes discovering and launching meme tokens fun, gamified, and accessible to anyone. The platform solves the problems of discoverability, creator incentives, and fragmented attention by turning content into currency and speculation into storytelling.

Here’s how Folktizen addresses the key problems:

1. **TikTok-Style Swipe Interface**
   Folktizen replaces complex dashboards with a short-form content feed, letting users swipe through meme pitches like they're browsing viral content. Each pitch includes a meme, caption, and optional video or audio—making participation intuitive, addictive, and familiar.
