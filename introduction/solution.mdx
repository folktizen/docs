Folktizen reimagines the meme coin launchpad as a TikTok-style, swipe-based social experience that makes discovering and launching meme tokens fun, gamified, and accessible to anyone. The platform solves the problems of discoverability, creator incentives, and fragmented attention by turning content into currency and speculation into storytelling.

Here’s how Folktizen addresses the key problems:

1. **TikTok-Style Swipe Interface** \
  Folktizen replaces complex dashboards with a short-form content feed, letting users swipe through meme pitches like they're browsing viral content. Each pitch includes a meme, caption, and optional video or audio—making participation intuitive, addictive, and familiar.

2. **Three-Stage Token Launch Pipeline** \
  Projects move through a transparent, community-powered pipeline:
    - **Genesis**: Meme ideas are posted by creators and browsed by users. Likes, comments, and FOLK stakes help gauge early interest.
    - **Bonding**: The most popular projects enter a bonding phase, where ETH is committed in exchange for tokens, locking in early community support.
    - **Graduation**: Once funding and validation thresholds are met, the meme coin officially launches and becomes tradeable.

3. **Like-to-Earn and Trade-to-Earn Mechanics** \
  Folktizen turns attention into rewards. Users earn FOLK by engaging with content (liking, commenting, sharing), and by participating in launches and secondary trading. This creates a sustainable reward loop tied directly to platform growth.

4. **On-Chain Creator Tools** \
  Creators get access to no-code token minting, prebuilt smart contracts, and campaign templates to turn their memes into tokens without writing code. Premium creators can access analytics, upgrade slots, and NFT-powered tools.

5. **Decentralized Vetting and Reputation** \
  Folktizen uses staking and bonding as public signals of trust, replacing opaque VC gatekeeping with transparent community interest. Creator profiles, project history, and bonding data are all on-chain for reputation tracking.

6. **Composable with Arbitrum Ecosystem** \
  Folktizen plugs into Arbitrum-native tools and protocols (e.g. GMX, Hype, Zora, Lens) to enhance interoperability and utility. This composability supports ecosystem expansion and cross-protocol incentives.

With this structure, Folktizen doesn’t just launch tokens—it incubates viral stories, builds creator economies, and reshapes how the internet monetizes culture.
